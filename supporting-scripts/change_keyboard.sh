# This script will assist in making temporary and permanent changes to the
# keyboard layout in SOF-ELK to facilitate international keyboards.
# Usage:
# sudo change_keyboard.sh <country_code>

# Keyboard country codes are typically two-letters (IT, DE, JP, etc.)
# The script will error out if an incorrect code is provided.
