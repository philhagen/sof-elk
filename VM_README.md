![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philhagen/sof-elk/master/lib/sof-elk_logo_sm.png)

## Background

This page contains details for the SOF-ELK® (Security Operations and Forensics Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) VM.
The VM is provided as a community resource but is covered at varying depths in the following SANS course(s):

* [SANS FOR572, Advanced Network Forensics and Analysis](http://for572.com/course)
* [SANS SEC555, SIEM with Tactical Analysis](http://for572.com/sec555)
* [SANS SEC501, Advanced Security Essentials - Enterprise Defender](http://for572.com/sec501)

The latest version of the VM itself is available here: <http://for572.com/sof-elk-vm>

All parsers and dashboards for this VM are now maintained in this Github repository.  You can access them directly via <http://for572.com/sof-elk-git>

## General Information

* The VM was created with VMware Fusion v11.0.2 and ships with virtual hardware v12.
  * If you're using an older version of VMware Workstation/Fusion/Player, you will likely need to convert the VM back to a previous version of the hardware.
  * Some VMware software provides this function via the GUI, or you may find the [free "VMware vCenter Converter" tool](http://www.vmware.com/products/converter) helpful.
* The VM is deployed with the "NAT" network mode enabled
* Credentials:
  * username: `elk_user`
    * password: `forensics`
    * has sudo access to run ALL commands
* Logstash will ingest all files from the following filesystem locations:
  * `/logstash/syslog/`: Syslog-formatted data
    * NOTICE: Remember that syslog DOES NOT reflect the year of a log entry!  Therefore, Logstash has been configured to look for a year value in the path to a file.  For example:  `/logstash/syslog/2015/var/log/messages` will assign all entries from that file to the year 2015.  If no year is present, the current year will be assumed.  This is enabled only for the `/logstash/syslog/` directory.
  * `/logstash/nfarch/`: Archived NetFlow output, formatted as described below
  * `/logstash/httpd/`: Apache logs in common, combined, or vhost-combined formats
  * `/logstash/passivedns/`: Logs from the passivedns utility
  * `/logstash/kape/`: JSON-format files generated by the [KAPE](https://learn.duffandphelps.com/kape) triage collection tool. ([See this document](doc/kape_support.md) for details on which specific output files are currently supported and their required file naming structure.)
  * `/logstash/plaso/`: CSV bodyfile-format files generated by the [Plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso) tool from the [log2timeline](https://github.com/log2timeline) framework. ([See this document](doc/log2timeline-plaso.md) for details on creating CSV files in a supported format.)
* Commands to be familiar with:
  * `/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_clear.py`: DESTROY contents of the Elasticsearch database.  Most frequently used with an index name base (e.g. `sof-elk_clear.py -i logstash` will delete all data from the Elasticsearch `logstash-*` indexes.  Other options detailed with the `-h` flag.
  * `/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_update.sh`: Update the SOF-ELK® configuration files from the Github repository.  (Requires sudo.)
* Files to be familiar with:
  * `/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf`: Symlinks to github-based FOR572-specific configs that address several common log formats:
    * syslog
    * DHCPD
    * BIND querylog
    * iptables
    * Squid access_log
    * Windows messages sent by Snare
    * Passivedns (<http://for572.com/passivedns>)
    * HTTPD Common/Combined/vhost+Combined/SSL Access Logs
    * Live NetFlow v5 and archived NetFlow records
* `/usr/local/sof-elk/*`: Clone of Github repository (<http://for572.com/sof-elk-git> - public/v20190606 branch)

## Latest Distribution Vitals

* Basic details on the distribution
  * VM is a CentOS 7.6 base with all OS updates as of 2019-06-06
  * Includes Elastic stack components v6.7.2
  * Configuration files are from the "public/v20190606" branch of this Github repository
* Metadata
  * Filename and size: `Public SOF ELK v20190606.zip` (`1,615,255,701` bytes)
  * MD5: `de54153fa977307f71f071f39c5b2670`
  * SHA256: `c0b70d2fde4b025e15867e2d44f937656b0a586acdb42932a665bc289c920853`

## How to Use

* Extract the compressed archive to your host system
* Open and boot the VM
* Log into the VM with the `elk_user` credentials (see above)
  * Logging in via SSH recommended, but if using the console login and a non-US keyboard, run `sudo loadkeys uk`, replacing `uk` as needed for your local keyboard mapping
* cd to one of the `/logstash/*/` directories as appropriate
* Place files in this location (Mind the above warning about the year for syslog data.  Files must also be readable by the "logstash" user.)
* Open the main Kibana dashboard using the Kibana URL shown in the pre-authentication screen, ```http://<ip_address>:5601```
  * This dashboard gives a basic overview of what data has been loaded and how many records are present
  * There are links to several stock dashboards on the left hand side
* Wait for Logstash to parse the input files, load the appropriate dashboard URL, and start interacting with your data

## Configuration Documentation

* Note: This will migrate to a new document at some point - just capturing here for the time being.
* Change replica count in `/etc/sysconfig/sof-elk` if using this in a cluster

## Sample Data Included

* Syslog data in `~elk_user/lab-2.3_source_evidence/`
  * Unzip each of these files **into the `/logstash/syslog/` directory**, such as: `cd /logstash/syslog/ ; unzip ~elk_user/lab-2.3_source_evidence/<file>`
  * Use the time frame `2013-06-08 15:00:00` to `2013-06-08 23:30:00` to examine this data.
* NetFlow data in `~elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/`
  * Use the `nfdump2sof-elk.sh` script and write output **to the `/logstash/nfarch/` directory**, such as: `cd /home/elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/ ; nfdump2sof-elk.sh -e 10.3.58.1 -r ~elk_user/lab-3.1_source_evidence/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/lab-3.1_netflow.txt`
  * Use the time frame `2012-04-02` to `2012-04-07` to examine this data.

## Ingesting Archived NetFlow

To ingest existing NetFlow evidence, it must be parsed into a specific format.  The included `nfdump2sof-elk.sh` script will take care of this.

* Read from single file: `nfdump2sof-elk.sh -r /path/to/netflow/nfcapd.201703190000 -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_1.txt`
* Read recursively from directory: `nfdump2sof-elk.sh -r /path/to/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_2.txt`
* Optionally, you can specify the IP address of the exporter that created the flow data: `nfdump2sof-elk.sh -e 10.3.58.1 -r /path/to/netflow/ -w /logstash/nfarch/inputfile_3.txt`
